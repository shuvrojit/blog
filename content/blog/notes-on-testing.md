`What to Test!!!`

Testing is about finding what doesn't work. It's not about what does work. Always test those things that you think is going to break the code or the system. Always think about what is going to the input and what is coming as a output. Test should always fail.

> Testing is the process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors (myers 1979)
